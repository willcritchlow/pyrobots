# This is a robots.txt file that causes the supposedly 'production'
# Google open source parser to misbehave and also exposes issues with
# the Search Console robots.txt checker.
#
# The Search Console checker will report that Googlebot is
# ALLOWED to crawl /bar/ which is incorrect - the "/" and everything
# after it should be ignored.
#
# The open source parser will report that googlebot-image is
# ALLOWED to crawl /bar/ which is incorrect - it should be blocked by
# the googlebot rule in the absence of a ruleset targeting
# googlebot-image.
